<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Elahe Kordtoodeshki, a passionate and results-driven software developer with over 16 years of experience 
  in the tech industry. I specialize in creating robust and scalable applications, utilizing a diverse set of programming languages
  and technologies such as Java, J2EE, Python, Node.js, React.js, Spring, and more.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from integrated management systems to core banking solutions,
  gaining a deep understanding of both backend and frontend development. My role as a Technical Supervisor at Fanap,
  where I lead teams in developing an Integrated University Management System (IUMS) and other ERP solutions,
  has given me the opportunity to not only design and build but also mentor my team members to achieve technical excellence.</p>

<p>I am skilled in working with databases like Oracle, MySQL, and SQL, and have extensive experience with modern tools like Docker,
  Kubernetes, GitHub, and Maven. My expertise extends to a range of development methodologies, including SCRUM, RUP,
  and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), allowing me to adapt to different workflows and deliver high-quality 
  solutions efficiently.</p>

<p>I’m particularly drawn to problem-solving and enjoy building systems that make complex challenges easier to manage and understand.
  Over the years, I’ve developed a knack for clean code and performance optimization, ensuring that my solutions not only meet 
  functional requirements but also maintain the highest standards of usability and accessibility.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am always eager to stay on top of emerging technologies and trends.I’m self-motivated,
  proactive, and thrive in fast-paced environments. Whether it's through pair programming,collaborating with teams, 
  or tackling complex system integrations, I bring enthusiasm and dedication to every project I undertake.</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, I enjoy pursuing my creative side through photography.Capturing the beauty in everyday moments and exploring 
  different perspectives allows me to express myself in a unique way. It’s a passion that complements my work, as I believe both 
  disciplines share a commitment to detail, precision, and vision. Photography has taught me to see the world through a different lens, 
  which also helps me approach problems and design solutions from fresh and innovative angles.

<p>I also pursued IT management during my master’s studies at Islamic Azad University, and I’m always excited to learn more about the 
  intersection of technology, creativity, and business.</p>
